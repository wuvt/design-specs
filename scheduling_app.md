website to create dj schedules 
===========================

- one interface to assign time slots which would be changed only rarely
- another to change DJs which would be more frequent
- ability to archive stuff so you can go back and view historical schedules
- survey functionality (like doodle or whenisgood, but determines the schedule with fewest overlaps)
- interface for DJs to remove or claim show slots, when they'll be gone
