Webapp to provide useful info for DJs
=========

As a DJ, finding info like the weather in Dublin, or the time of the next
Hokies game (or any other game by any other local team), or the name of the DJ
with the show after me and the name of their show, or what PSA or promo to read
is hard.

We should have an app that sources this data from apropriate places and
displays it on one or more tabs for DJs to read during their show.

In the future, this could incorporate underwriting and PSA scripts, as well as
general info, twitter or news feeds, or even arbitrary data that DJs may want
to know so they can read off the air (short, prepared news blurbs, etc).
